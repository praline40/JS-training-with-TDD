# JS Training with TDD

Credits: [Cl√©ment Denis](https://github.com/kigiri) for the [original repo](https://github.com/nan-academy/js-training).

## Setup

### 1. Get this repo

First, [**fork**](https://github.com/WildCodeSchool/js-training-tdd/fork?fragment=1) this repository: you'll then have a copy of this repo under your GitHub account.

Then go to wherever you store your development work, and run these commands to clone the forked repo (replace `GITHUB_LOGIN` with your login):

```sh
# download your code locally
git clone https://github.com/GITHUB_LOGIN/js-training-tdd.git

# change working directory to the newly cloned repository
cd js-training-tdd
```
**Prerequisites**: you must have installed Git!

Node.js is a platform which makes it possible to run JavaScript code outside the web browser.

You have to install Node.js, preferably **not** with the packages on Node's download page.

### 2. Install Node.js

#### On Linux/MacOS

**Note for Linux users**: before going further, run `which curl` in the terminal. If it shows something (e.g. `/usr/bin/curl`), you're good! Otherwise, run `sudo apt install -y curl` (Ubuntu/Debian) to install cURL.

You are going to use NVM (Node Version Manager). Here's a summary of what you have to do (see [installation instructions](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#installation-and-update) on the NVM repo for more details). Run these commands in your terminal:

```sh
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.35.3/install.sh | bash
source ~/.bashrc
nvm install v12.16.1
nvm use v12.16.1
```

You can verify that it worked by running `node -v`, which should display:

    v12.16.1

#### On Windows

The original NVM doesn't support Windows. You're going to use [NVM for Windows](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows). Get to the [releases page](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows/releases). Under the latest version (1.1.7 as of September 2019), download the `nvm-setup.zip` file (or use this [direct link](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows/releases/download/1.1.7/nvm-setup.zip)).

Extract the archive, and run `nvm-setup.exe`. Complete the setup wizard. Then, quit Git Bash if it is running, re-launch it, and type:

```sh
nvm install v12.16.1
nvm use v12.16.1
```

Running `node -v` should display: `v12.16.1`.

## Testing

Once you have coded your masterpiece, you can start testing your solutions.

You can run tests for a single section:
```sh
# run the test runner with args ( basics, advanced, math, get)
./tester basics
```

![output-tester-basics](https://github.com/WildCodeSchool/js-training-tdd/blob/master/img/output-tester-basics.png)

**Later on**, you may use `tester` with no argument, to check exercises from _all_ sections (in this example, `basics`, `math` and part of `str` have been solved):

```sh
# run the test runner
./tester
```
![output-tester](https://github.com/WildCodeSchool/js-training-tdd/blob/master/img/output-tester.png)

## Solving

You can start editing the JavaScript files with your favorite text editor i.e. VSCode, Atom, Sublime Text, etc.
